# DashPandas

This project uses Dash Plotly in combination with the Pandas library to create a dashboard using Google Seets Data. 
This particular project does not need the Google Sheets API or 0auth library in order to import the sheet, making it a 
lighter overall solution. The aim is to allow projects to easily modify this project to create dashboards with Google Sheets data
and Pandas Dataframes.
